##BankOfSuccess

I have developed a banking system application where we can create account, transfer amount from one account to another and also withdraw and deposit amount to our account.

This Project based on OOPs Concept

And some principles like SRP(Single Responsibility Principle) and open/closed principle.

Also i have implemented some of Unit Test Cases for that code.
